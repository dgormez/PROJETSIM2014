Projet SIM : Système d'information de radiologie
================================================
This project has been developed by Botquin Y., De Almeida L., Gérard M., Gormez D.
It simulates a RIS (Radiology Information System) where :
-the user can generate a DICOM WorkList from an electronic identity card (BeID - Belgium only).
-the image acquisition is simulated with a Webcam taking a simple picture and generating a DICOM File
-the file is then stored on a PACS and data into a database
-The "patient" can then access its information through a web interface
